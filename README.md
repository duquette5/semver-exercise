# Sematic Versioning Exercise

## Objective

Learn about how to assign version numbers to changes to code.
 
## Version Numbering

One of the things that you need to decide on when building systems (and required by Maven) is a version number of the artifact to be built. But how do you decide on the format of the version number, and when and why you update it (or its parts)?

## Instructions

### Read:

* The [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org) Specification.
* [Semantic Versioning vs. Romantic Versioning](http://dafoster.net/articles/2015/03/14/semantic-versioning-vs-romantic-versioning/)

### Review the example code

Review the code at [https://github.com/kwurst/semver-exercise](https://github.com/kwurst/semver-exercise) and **note that this code is given the version number 1.0.0.**

Answer the following question:

* Which would be more appropriate for the example code: Semantic Versioning or Romantic Versioning. Why?

### Assign a new version number to each of the following branches

For each of the branches:

* [Issue A](https://github.com/kwurst/semver-exercise/compare/issue-a)
* [Issue B](https://github.com/kwurst/semver-exercise/compare/issue-b)
* [Issue C](https://github.com/kwurst/semver-exercise/compare/issue-c)

do the following:

* Review the differences between the original code and the branch.
	* Explain the change that was made.
	* Determine what the new version number should be.
	* Explain your reasoning for chosing that version number.

*Note that these changes are not sequential. Issue A is a change to the original example code. The same is true of Issue B and Issue C.*

## Deliverables

1. In a document:
	1. Type the answers to the question about which versioning system you would choose, and why.
	2. Type the answers for the three questions for each branch.
